# Bonus Marks
## Command Pattern Implementation
For the bonus marks assignment, I implemented a simple Command Pattern implementation that allows for the plyaer's inputs and car's movements to be entirely compartmentalized and command-based. The logic behind the pattern is simple and as instructed in class, we have an input which is then encapsulated by the engine, and that encapsulated command is then called to execute a different event. All resulting in the player moving.

## Explanation
For this assignment I used a Dirty Flag pattern to ensure that the player camera would shake upon the player cahracter's car (represented as a red cube). After the car collides and a variable is set to true (isCrashed?) then the camera shakes activates. It is simplistic and to the point.

I could have definitely used far more time with my Camera Shake mechanic as most of my time was consumed by the building of character movement. Besides that, my camera shake is so minimal I'm not sure it is there and I am simply hallucinating it. Overall, I feel like I did my best.
